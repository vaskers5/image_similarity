# Image Similarity NFT images

Implementation of [this](https://medium.com/pytorch/image-similarity-search-in-pytorch-1a744cf3469  "MEMES") paper on NFT images dataset.

The dataset you can find [here](), the checkpoints for models you can find [here]().

[Example in colab notebook]()

The project builds embeddings using convolutional neural networks and then finds the closest image using the nearest neighbor algorithm.

## Node:
In order to disprove this with a picture not from a dataset, keep in mind that you need to build your own embeddings. To do this, use this [notebook]().

## Work examples:
